        <h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Bed Models</h3>
        <p>This tool allows for importing information from bed files to make new models based on a reference model.</p>
        <h4>Bead Selection Mode</h4>
        <p>The "Bead selection mode" changes how beads are selected from each bed entry.</p>
        <p>"In range" will select all beads that are within or partially within the specified range in the bed entry.</p>
        <p>"Strictly in range" will only select beads that are entirely within the specified range in the bed entry.</p>
        <p>"Start", "Middle" and "End" will select the bead containing the first, middle or last basepair respectively in the specified range in the bed entry.</p>
        <h4>Colour Options</h4>
        <p>This is where you may choose how the selected beads will be coloured.</p>
        <p>"Use single colour" will use the selected colour for the entire new model.</p>
        <p>"Use score for colours" allows for colouring the new model based on score values in the bed file. A colour gradient can be set here between two colours and two score values either specified as the values themselves or as percentiles.</p>
        <p>"Use colour from file" will use the colours specified in each bed entry.</p>
        <p>"Retain colours" will use the colours from the reference model.</p>
        <p>Should multiple bed entries attempt to colour the same bead in deifferent colours, the colours will be blended together or optionally a conflict colour can be set that will be used instead when such conflicts occur.</p>
        <h4>Score Cutoff</h4>
        <p>If score cutoff is enabled, bed entries outside the specified range will be ignored. The range can be specified either with score values or percentiles.</p>
        <h4>General Options</h4>
        <p>"Main model ID" is a field for specifying what model is to be used as reference for the bed tool. The bed entries will select beads on this model and make a new model with copies of the reference model's beads.</p>
        <p>"New model name" is the name that the new model will be given. If left empty the filename of the bed file will be used.</p>
        <p>"Hide beads on main model" will hide the beads on the main model that correspond to the beads selected by the bed tool. This is can be useful since the draw order of models in ChimeraX depend on the lighting mode and the model IDs. So if you want to show a model on top of the main model this is a "quick and dirty" way of doing it without changing model IDs or using other tools.</p>
        <p>Hidden beads can be shown again using the <a href="../commands/show.html">show</a> command or show atoms tool.</p>
