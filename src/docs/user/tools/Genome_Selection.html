        <h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Genome Selection</h3>
        <p>This tool is for selecting beads on a model by using the actual chomosome base-pair ranges they represent.</p>
        <p>The selection is added to any existing selection. Deselecting all can be done by Ctrl clicking in the scene or by using the command select clear.</p>
        <h4>General Options</h4>
        <p>"chrID" is the chromosome ID of the chromosome to select from as it is in the .cmm file. If you are unsure of what your chromosome IDs are you can use the dump tool to inspect the chrID field of the beads.</p>
        <p>"From" and "To" specifies the pase-pair range to select with the "From" value being inclusive and the "To" value being exclusive.</p>
        <p>"Model ID" is the ID of the model to perform the selection on.</p>
        <h4>Bead Selection Mode</h4>
        <p>The bead selection mode specifies how the beads are selected.</p>
        <p>"In range" will select all beads that are within or partially within the specified range.</p>
        <p>"Strictly in range" will only select beads that are entirely within the specified range.</p>
