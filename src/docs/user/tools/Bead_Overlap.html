        <h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Overlap Tool</h3>
        <p>The Overlap Tool makes a new model based on overlaps between existing models.</p>
        <p>For this explanation we will be using this example:</p>
        <p>We have two models A and B with IDs 1 and 2 respectively. Model A contains bead 1, 2 and 3, model B contains bead 2, 3 and 4. The resulting overlap between model A and B consists of the beads 2 and 3.</p>
        <p>The Overlap tool works on a rule based system.</p>
        <p>To add a rule click the"+" button.</p>
        <p>Each rule has three fields.</p>
        <p>The first field is for specifying the overlap. This is specified using comma separated model IDs or model names in double quotes. In our example the overlap between models A and B can be specified as:</p>
        <p>1, 2<br />"A", "B"<br />or even<br />"A", 2</p>
        <p>The second field is a dropdown menu for specifying what to do with the beads selected in the first field. The option is between colouring them in a certain colour, retaining colours or not including them in the new model. When retaining colours the colours are taken from the first specified model.</p>
        <p>The third field is a colour picker for the colour to use for the beads if colouring is selected in the second field.</p>
        <p>To remove a rule click that rule's "-" button. To rearrange the priorities of the rules use the arrow buttons.</p>
        <p>In the examples "[...]" is used to show a field</p>
        <p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
        <p>Colour model A blue, model B red, and the overlap between them green.</p>
        <p>Rules in order:</p>
        <p>[1, 2][Colour][green]<br />[1][Colour][blue]<br />[2][Colour][red]</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
        <p>Colour model A blue and model B red but do not include the overlap between them.</p>
        <p>Rules in order:</p>
        <p>[1, 2][Don't include][]<br />[1][Colour][blue]<br />[2][Colour][red]</p>
        <p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
        <p>Make a model containing the overlap between A and B and keep the colours from B.</p>
        <p>Rules in order:</p>
        <p>[2, 1][Retain colours][]</p>
