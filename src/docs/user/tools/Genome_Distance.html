        <h3><a href="../index.html#tools">Tool</a>: Genome Distance</h3>
        <p>This tool is for measuring distances and has three ways of doing so:</p>
        <p>"Pairwise Distances" will calculate all pairwise distances between beads within a model.</p>
        <p>"Distance Between Models" will calculate all distances between the beads in the two models.</p>
        <p>"Distance from Point" will calculate all distances from that point to all beads in the model.</p>
        <p>The results are given as an array and can be saved as a .npy file.</p>
        <p>A histogram is also generated from the results.</p>
        <h4>Distance Options</h4>
        <p>Here one can choose what distance metric to use.</p>
        <h4>Histogram Options</h4>
        <p>Here are options for the generated histogram.</p>
        <p>"Bins" refer to the amount of bins to be used for the histogram.</p>
        <p>If "Use cutoff" is enabled, the the cutoff "min" and "max" values will be used to cut off values outside of that range when generating the histogram.</p>
